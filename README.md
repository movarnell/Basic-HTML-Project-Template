Welcome to the Basic HTML Project Template repository! This template provides a foundational structure for starting your HTML projects with CSS and JavaScript configurations already set up.

## Features

## Quick Start

### 1. Create Your Repository

Firstly, make this template a repository by clicking the appropriate button. This action will generate a new repository on your GitHub account using this template.

### 2. Set Up Your Local Project

**a. Create a Folder**: On your local machine, decide where you want your project to reside. Navigate to that directory and create a new folder for your project.

Example using terminal or command prompt:
```bash
cd path/to/your/directory
mkdir your-project-name
```

**b. Clone the Repository**: Navigate to the folder you just created and clone the new repository you made from the template.
```bash
cd your-project-name
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git .
```
**Note**: The `.` at the end of the `git clone` command ensures that the repository is cloned into the current directory.

### 3. Start Coding

Now that everything is set up, you can begin coding! Open the project in your favorite code editor and start building.

### 4. Push Changes to GitHub

After making changes, you can easily push your updates back to your GitHub repository.
```bash
# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit the changes with a message
git commit -m "Your commit message here"

# Push to your GitHub repository
git push origin main
```
